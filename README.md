Go DNS Sniffer
=======

Go DNS Sniffer: Simple sniffer and logger of DNS requestes, written on GO.

### Building From Source and Installation

To build Gophish from source, simply run ```go get github.com/khajiitstolenothing/godnsniffer``` and ```cd``` into the project source directory. Then, run ```go build```. After this, you should have a binary called ```godnsffier``` in the current directory.

###Notice

I know that code is crap, but it works, so whatever. If you want to do it better feel free to fork.
