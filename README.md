Go DNS Sniffer
=======

Go DNS Sniffer: Simple sniffer and logger of DNS requestes, written on GO.

### Building From Source and Installation

To build godnsniffer from source, simply run ```go get github.com/khajiitstolenothing/godnsniffer``` and ```cd``` into the project source directory. Then, run ```go build```. After this, you should have a binary called ```godnsffier``` in the current directory.

### Usage

By default you only need to specify ```-zone``` flag with domain name you have. For security purposes additionally change ```-username``` and ```-password``` used to login to the web interface with logs.

### Notice

I know that code is crap, but it works, so whatever. If you want to do it better feel free to fork.
